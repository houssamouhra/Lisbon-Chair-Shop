## About This Project

This project was completed as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS" course. The HTML structure was provided in the course, and the CSS was written entirely by me as part of the learning process.

This project provide a good practice of UI/UX, Layouts, Flexbox and Grid.
